# Password Generator



## The process


### What i did
* Created arrays to store all the letters, numbers and special charaters
* Then I created the function generatePassword that will execute the random password
* I created prompts and confirms to decide the length and what charaters in the password
* I made an if statement for if they put in a value over 128 or under 8 it would tell themn to choose between those numbers
* Created a long if statement for when the user selects their criteria that outputs what they selected so it could be all 4 or 3 or 2 or just 1
* Created a for loop that will randomly select from the user choices that makes a random password
